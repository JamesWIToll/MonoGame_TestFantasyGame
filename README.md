# Test Fantasy Game
## This project is a kind of testing grounds for learning the Monogame C# game dev framework (https://monogame.net/).
## A lot of the content of this project is bits and pieces from accross the web that I reworked and put together 
## into my own project to learn how things work. If any of my code pulls heavily from something found elsewhere
## I will credit the place where I found the original code.


## Asset Credits
Most of the assets included in this project are not my assets.

the assets found in Content/2d/Soldier and Content/2d/Orc come from this asset pack

most of the content of Content/2d/Objects and Content/2d/Tiles come from this asset pack
https://codespree.itch.io/top-down-tiled-rpg-assets by CodeSpree on itch.io

the following files came from my wonderful partner Jackie Tamayao who was so excited to
see me draw tiles to the screen that they wanted to contribute some tiles:

## How To Play This Demo Game
I've gone ahead and built this game for Linux x64 and Windows x64. If you are interested
in seeing how this messy demo looks in action you can download the files and run the following
executables -

Linux:
bin/Release/linux-x64/publish/TestFantasyGame

Windows:
bin/Release/win-x64/publish/TestFantasyGame.exe

## Controls
W - Move Up
A - Move Left
S - Move Down
D - Move Right

J - Attack

Down arrow key - Camera Zoom out
Up Arrow Key   - Camera Zoom In

## Tips 
Run around to try and avoid the orcs. If you move out of thier range before the
end of their attack they will not hit you. Try to start your attack before getting
next to an orc - your attacks also only 'connect' at the end of the attack animation.
 Damage is random bc why not lol.
